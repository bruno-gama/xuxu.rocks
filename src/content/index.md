## **What I've been doing** - <span class="pink-text">06/2018</span>:

Initially I planned this to be a monthly update, but I only updated after a
whole year 😅. Anyway here is a short report of the last 12 months.

* <span class="blue-text">**My main objective for 2018 is to get into Open Source**</span>.
* It's a challenge to find open source projects I want to contribute to.
* After working a whole year @ [Tuneduc](http://tuneduc.com.br) I feel like I have a really good grasp in ReactJS development, as well as agile methodology.
* I want to make a new version of this site, maybe update the styles too.
* New version would be a nice opportunity to learn how to use AWS Lambda and generate static HTMLs in an S3 bucket so I could leave heroku.
* I can say I'm a card-carrying member of the <span class="green-text">**Functional Programming**</span> gang by now.
* I've been studying <span class="red-text">**ReasonML**</span> really hard and plan to start a ReasonReact project soon.
* Been going to tons of meetups and dev events, the <span class="purple-text">**ReactBrasil**</span> community is amazing.
* I learned how to do front-end dev in Linux and honestly I like it better than MacOS

## **What I was doing** - <span class="pink-text">06/2017</span>:

* Landed a new job at [Tuneduc](http://tuneduc.com.br)!!! I'm learning how to work in a real software development team and loving it.
* Studying hard so I get to understand everything that's possible about React JS
* Attempting to join the <span class="green-text">**Functional Programming in Javascript**</span> bandwagon
* Attempting to learn how to use <span class="purple-text">**tmux + vim**</span> in my development workflow
* Figuring out the best method to allow me to update files in a dropbox-like folder and have them reflected in a URL on this site (like http://xuxu.rocks/notes/a-nice-note)

## What I'm reading

Started downloading stuff from [aaaaarg.fail](http://aaaaarg.fail) so now I have a gorillion things to read all at once:
